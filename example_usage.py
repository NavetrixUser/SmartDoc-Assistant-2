    Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview
    
    Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines 
    that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, 
    reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
    
    Types of AI:
    1. Narrow AI (Weak AI): Designed for specific tasks
    2. General AI (Strong AI): Human-level intelligence across all domains
    3. Superintelligence: AI that surpasses human intelligence
    
    Applications of AI:
    - Healthcare: Medical diagnosis and drug discovery
    - Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
    - Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
    - Entertainment: Recommendation systems
    - Education: Personalized learning platforms

    Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn 
    and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build mathematical 
    models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    
    1. Supervised Learning:
       - Uses labeled training data
       - Examples: Classification, Regression
       - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
    
    2. Unsupervised Learning:
       - Finds patterns in data without labels
       - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
       - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders
    
    3. Reinforcement Learning:
       - Learns through interaction with environment
       - Uses rewards and penalties
       - Applications: Game playing, Robotics
    
    Popular ML Libraries:
    - Python: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
    - R: caret, randomForest

    Deep Learning and Neural Networks
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple 
    layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's inspired by the 
    structure and function of the human brain.
    
    Key Concepts:
    
    Neural Networks:
    - Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons)
    - Each connection has a weight
    - Activation functions determine output
    
    Deep Neural Networks:
    - Multiple hidden layers
    - Can learn hierarchical representations
    - Automatic feature extraction
    
    Popular Architectures:
    
    1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
       - Excellent for image processing
       - Use convolution and pooling layers
       - Applications: Computer vision, medical imaging
    
    2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
       - Process sequential data
       - Have memory capabilities
       - Applications: Natural language processing, time series
    
    3. Transformers:
       - Attention-based architecture
       - Parallel processing capabilities
       - Applications: Language models, machine translation
    
    Training Process:
    - Forward propagation
    - Loss calculation
    - Backpropagation
    - Weight updates using optimizers (SGD, Adam)
